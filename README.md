### **Customer_Churn_Sprint**
Predict customer churn for Sprint, a major US telecommunications company. This Machine learning project helps retain customers & and optimize services.

## **Week 1 Project Description**:

This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn for Sprint, one of the largest telecom companies in the USA. Customer churn, or the rate customers leave a service provider, is a critical concern for businesses like Sprint. Predicting churn allows telecom companies to retain valuable customers and optimize their services proactively.

In this project, we leverage historical customer data, including information about customer demographics, contract details, usage patterns, and churn status.

## **Overview**

Customer churn is the percentage of customers who stopped using a company's product or service during a certain time frame. This situation is a real problem across many global industries, and the average churn rate can be surprisingly high. For some global markets, churn rates can be as high as 30%. According to an article published by [Paddle](https://www.paddle.com/resources/industry-retention-rates), Churn rates are among the highest in the United States and it is due to the challenge of switching. Loyalty programs, long-term contracts, and similar services among competitors discourage customers from leaving. Solutions to mitigating the effects of customer churn involve companies seeking to improve the quality of their customer service, issue more personalized offers, engage in competitive pricing, provide quality service, or leverage the power of machine learning to predict customer churn rates - which is what this project entails. This project employs various machine-learning techniques and models to build a robust customer churn prediction system. The ultimate goal is to develop a model that can effectively identify customers at risk of churning for the upcoming months, enabling Sprint to take proactive measures to retain them. 

We will discuss the machine-learning techniques and models that were used in the project below:

- **Ridge Classifier**: Ridge classifiers are suitable for binary classification problems like churn prediction. They can handle features that may be correlated, which is common in customer data. By using Ridge Classifier, you account for potential correlations among customer attributes, helping to make accurate churn predictions.

+ **XGBoost Classifier**: XGBoost is a powerful ensemble learning algorithm known for its ability to handle complex relationships in the data. In the context of customer churn prediction, it can capture intricate patterns and interactions among various features. This is vital as churn is often influenced by multiple factors, and XGBoost's predictive capacity is highly relevant for such scenarios.

* **Logistic Regression**: Logistic regression is a simple yet effective algorithm for binary classification tasks. Its relevance lies in its interpretability. By using logistic regression, you can understand how individual features impact the likelihood of churn. This interpretability can be crucial for identifying which customer characteristics are driving churn.

* **Random Forest Classifier**: Random forests are well-suited for scenarios with diverse data types and complex relationships. In the telecom industry, customer data can be multifaceted, including demographic, behavioral, and transactional attributes. Random forests can effectively handle this diversity, making them relevant for predicting churn.

## **Defining a Churn Event**.

A Churn Event could manifest in a variety of factors. This stems from Customer Complaints where a High number of customer complaints may be indicative of underlying issues with service quality, billing, or customer support, leading to dissatisfaction and churn, or whether or not a customer is an active member as active members, who actively engage with Sprint's services and promotions, are more likely to stay. Inactive members may not see the value in continuing with Sprint. Our Machine Learning Project will fulfill its purpose of predicting the specific factors that correspond to Sprint customer churn rates. 

## **The Data Collection Process**

After we have defined a churn event, We will obtain data on these factors as well as other factors. These include the customer's **ID**- a unique identifier for a sprint customer, their **Age**, the **Contract_Type** which varied from Month to Month or Annual, **Monthly_Charges** - for their sprint services,  **Tenure** - the number of years they have been at Sprint,  **Total_Charges** - which was a product of the Monthly Charges and the Tenure, Phone_Service - which measures if the customer has phone service or not, **Multiple_Lines** - if they have multiple phone lines on the sprint network, **Online_Backup** of their sprint service data, **Active_Member** - a status to indicate whether or not they are still active on the sprint network and lastly, **Customer_Complaints** - which measures whether or not a customer has complained about a sprint product or service in the past.
